## Description

**WORK AND REST**

A new timer that helps you focus on completing your goals at work. 
Use your countdown timer to keep yourself on track by setting a goal for how long you want to work on each task.

USSR-POMODORO provides a simple, but effective, UI to manage these periods of focus and relaxation. USSR-POMODORO is based on the Pomodoro technique for time management. When faced with any large task or series of tasks, break the work down into short, timed intervals (called 'Pomodoros') that are spaced out by short breaks. This allows you to immerse your mind, and get good work done.
## How to use

1. Decide on the task that you will perform.
2. Set the timer "Time" required for work.
3. Work without distraction until the timer rings.
4. Take a short break (time to tune with the "Little Break" twist).
5. After each end of all working cycles, take a long break (time to adjust with the "Big Break" twist).
6. Cycles adjust the number of work periods before the big break.
